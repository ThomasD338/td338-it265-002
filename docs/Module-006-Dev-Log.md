#### Goals for this Module
<!-- Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate
- [ ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2
- [ ] Goal 3
-->
- [x] Game Design Treatment
- [x] Playtest game with friends
- [ ] Update and make refinements based on feedback from playtest

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I was able to submit the game design treatment assignment. I also got my game into a position where I could fairly rigorously playtest the game with a group of my friends. The playtest exposed quite a few flaws and holes in my game's rules.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - A main issue I had with the game was how players obtained new cards, as well as a way to remove unwanted cards from your deck
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - While I'm still trying to iron out certain details for a proper solutions, I introduced the shop system where players use their unused action cards to purchase items at the end of the round. I also introduced handoff mechanic that allows cards to be transferred between players
  - I still have yet to create items/spells/rules to remove a card, though I plan to do a mix of both creating new items/spells and editing existing ones to create this dynamic of thinning your deck.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- There were many holes in my game's rules that I only fully realized during playtesting. I'd like to playtest more when I refine the rules of the game, as playtesting seems to be very helpful in this regard.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  N/A

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- I need to make and order some of the final assets for my board game
- I need to refine some of the rules based off my first playtest
