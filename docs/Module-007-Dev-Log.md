- [x] Presentation

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I was able to present my physical board game concept to the class. I put together the cards and board for my game over spring break and make some last minute adjustments to rules before I presented.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - From the playtest I ran with three of my friends, I noticed several different balancing issues between both the player-player and player-game environments. Some weapons, spells,F and items were much weaker than others, despite being of the same rarity. The "tank" enemy type was way too difficult to deal with, and with the limited starting hand size, it felt impossible to buy rare or even uncommon items from the shop.
- **Solutions**:
  - I introduced double-attack cards to both make tank enemies easier to deal with and give more value to one card within the shop, making it easier to purchase items. I also went through the list of spells and items to buff underpowered cards.

#### Learnings
- From both my own presentation as well as others, I've realized how just how hard it is to "teach a game" to an audience. I tried to follow a structured flow of the game during my presentation, but with the way that mechanics rely on other mechanics, it's hard to break information down to digestable chunks without leaving out crucial information. It was easier to just throw everything out at once, but that wall of information isn't going to be understood by anyone at all.

#### Free Thinking
- N/A

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- It wouldn't hurt to get a headstart on creating the digital prototype. It'd be nice to get started on the very basics of the Godot project by the end of this week.
