## Vision Statement
*What is the mission of your solo game studio? How does it align with creating and analyzing innovative game architectures?*

> Create video games that will give players long-lasting memories and experiences. Challenge players with a daunting task, but reward them when they manage to succeed.

---

## Core Values
*What principles guide your studio's approach to game design, architecture, and development?*

- Player experience first: Would interacting with this mechanic/feature improve the player's enjoyment of the game?
- Experimentation: The first iteration of a game mechanic shouldn't make it into the game. Test it with different rules and see where it works best before implementation.
- Open to critique: Throughout the entire development process, listen to others' input and opinions.

-- **Sketches/Logo**:
I already have a logo that I use for my profile pictures in games. Perhaps I could re-purpose this for my studio logo.

## Additional Notes
*Include any other ideas, inspirations, or thoughts related to your studio or project.*

> In regards to card games: I've always enjoyed the idea of poker hands, but after sinking 200+ hours into Balatro, I'm slightly concerned that I may draw too much inspiration from the game.
> Perhaps a standard 52-card deck will be too limiting? What if the game revolved around cards fully unique to just the game?
> I enjoy the standard seven dice from TTRPGS. I've only played D&D 5e, and one thing I feel the system underutilizes is "upgrading" your dice. For example, turning a d4 roll into a d6 or d8. The only instances I can think of where D&D uses this is the Monk's martial arts die and certain cantrips getting stronger at higher player levels. Perhaps explore the concept of "upgrading" dice.
