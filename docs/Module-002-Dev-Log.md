#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- Even in old Atari games, there are many game design lessons to learn. Primarily, in such a limited game system, the idea of conveying information clearly was a large issue that had to be addressed for these games.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  What do I want to do for my board/card game? I really like the idea of a PvE board game, as most board games are player vs player.
-  The only issue is how would I create an enemy? Perhaps it is simply some task that the players must do within a certain time. An actual enemy the player must fight would require some sort of AI, including decision trees for how they move and what attack they select.
-  That would also mean that the players would have to constantly consult a manual to see what the enemy does, but no player is going to read anything to play the game.
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  I should land on a final idea for my board/card game very soon.
