#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I completed the case study assignment
  - I was able to finalize the basic grid movement and include a few functions that will be helpful for items that affect grid movement later on.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - N/A
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - N/A

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- From the slides in-class, I learned that parallax can often serve as more than just a visual effect to make games look nice. It can also influence gameplay by hinting the player on what they should focus on.
- I learned a lot more about the backstory behind the game I chose for my case study, which was Outer Wilds.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  N/A
   
#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- As I have finished the movement system for my game, I'll go on to making a functioning deck system for each player, allowing them to add and remove cards. I may make the functionality of some of the more basic cards as well.
