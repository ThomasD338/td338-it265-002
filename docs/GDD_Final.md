## Changelog:
Ignoring mechanics cut due to time constraints:
 - Added double attack cards
Tanks were very difficult to take down, and there were very few ways to damage an enemy more than once in a turn (certain spells, shuriken item). Additionally, it was extremely difficult to purchase higher rarity items within the game. Double attack cards would provide a reliable way to deal multiple attacks in a turn and double as a stronger currency within the slot of one card to provide more buying power during the shop phase.
- Added chance for no enemy to spawn on a tile
Having a constant 6 enemies every turn made the game very overwhelming very quickly. This mechanic added a small layer of balance and tweaking for the game, and made it feel more varied.
- Added ability to hand off cards between players
This change was added for several reasons. It added another layer of interaction between players in an area where the game was already lacking. Before this change, there were very few ways of assisting your allies directly. This allowed allowed some deck manipulation, the ability for one player to buy a item/equipment and then hand it off to another player in a future turn, and allowed players to "pool their money together" to try to make one big purchase.
- Added/tweaked many items to remove cards from your deck
Deck fixing is an important mechanic in all roguelike deckbuilders, and this game originally lacked it entirely. By implementing ways to thin your deck, it further supported the dynamic of smaller decks being able to draw more favorable cards faster, while larger decks were more resistant to injury cards.
